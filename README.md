# Overview
Our web application project creates a platform for SFU students to buy and sell textbooks or other resources from or to their peers.

Currently, existing platforms for SFU students to purchase used textbooks is either through social media such as Facebook, books2go.com, or directly at the school's bookstore. The SFU bookstore sells mostly brand new books, with limited selection of choices available for second hand. Moreover, used book in bookstore often more expensive than online platform. 

Altough, Facebook is not a platform design specifically for buying and selling books in particular; in fact, the method used right now is through posts made in different groups, or private messaging which is very unsecure. Books2go allows the purchasing of textbooks among all students across Canada, but is not widely known, and is also lacking in some aspects, for example, the ability to make reviews or comment about seller.

In this project, we will attempt to create and enhance the platform to buy and sell textbooks for students specifically directed towards SFU.
